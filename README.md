For the .crx  file you just need to enable the developer mode at the extensions, take the file and just drag it to the extensions, that's all! 

So many of you liked my Pet Simulator 99 Pet Adder/Hacker, thank you for feedback on discord!
I made one for robux, that simply bypasses the robux system, and you can add yourself robux.

HAS A LIMIT!!
I made a limit, daily 2000. Because i don't want roblox to find out fast about this, and i want to "help" more people.
If you delete the extension and re-install it the timer not gonna reset.

DESIGN:
The design is very simple now, but if you want newer design just tell me, i'll make it.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, OR WANT THE VIP VERSION (DAILY 5000 ROBUX) JUST WRITE ME ON DISCORD
